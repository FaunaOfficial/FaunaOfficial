Trust Wallet Assets Info
Check

Overview
Trust Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

Trust Wallet uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc. For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so feel free to add your token.



How to add token
Please note that brand new tokens are not accepted, the projects have to be sound, with information available, and non-minimal circulation (for limit details see https://developer.trustwallet.com/assets/requirements).

Assets App
The Assets web app can be used for most new token additions (Github account is needed).

Quick starter
Details of the repository structure and contribution guidelines are listed on the Developers site. Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.
